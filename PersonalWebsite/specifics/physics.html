    What I have done
  </span></h2>

  <p class = "movedleft">
    I have studied Physics alongside Applied Mathematics.  In fact you can say
    the two fields are one in the same.  I greatly enjoy studying both fields,
    and would be happy earning a PhD. In either field.

    Research
  </span></h2>

  <p class = "movedleft">
    I have done experimental research in Physics, in which I used a microwave
    reactor to synthesize nanoparticles of Copper and Nickel.  The goal
    of this was to study the effects of time span and temperature on the
    sizes and compositions of the particles.
